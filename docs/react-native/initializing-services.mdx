# Initializing Services

In this section, we will show you how to initialize all avaiable Busy Hour Services in your React Native apps.

## Initializing Activity Feeds

To use the activity feeds functionality, you need to initialize the activity feeds service first. To initialize the activity feeds service, you can use `useInitActivityFeed` hook which is exported from the `@busy-hour/react-native/hooks` package. The hook itself takes a boolean argument which determines if the service should be initialized or not.

:::info

<span>{initializing.info}</span>
:::

### Quick Example

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import { useInitActivityFeed } from '@busy-hour/react-native/hooks';

export default Main() {
  // highlight-start
  // We recommend you to use a state as the argument instead of fixed value
  // therefore the initialization will only happen once the service are initialized
  useInitActivityFeed(true)
  // highlight-end

  return <MainApp />
}
```

## Initializing Messaging

To use the messaging functionality, you need to initialize two of the following services:

- Messaging
- Push Notifications

### Initializing Messaging

To initialize only the messaging service without the notification, you can use the `useInitMessaging` hook which is exported from the `@busy-hour/react-native/hooks` package. The hook itself takes a boolean argument which determines if the service should be initialized or not.

:::info

<span>{initializing.info}</span>
:::

### Quick Example

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import { useInitMessaging } from '@busy-hour/react-native/hooks';

export default Main() {
  // highlight-start
  // We recommend you to use a state as the argument instead of fixed value
  // therefore the initialization will only happen once the service are initialized
  useInitMessaging(true)
  // highlight-end

  return <MainApp />
}
```

### Initializing Push Notifications

To receive the new incoming messages as a notification, you need to initialize the notification services. To initialize it, you can use the `useInitNotification` hook which is exported from the `@busy-hour/react-native/hooks` package. Like the messaging service, the hook itself takes a boolean argument which determines if the service should be initialized or not.

When initializing the notification service, you will get an object as the return value which contains `isInitialized` and `isError` properties to determine if the service is initialized or not.

:::info

<span>{initializing.info}</span>
:::

### Quick Example

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import { useInitNotification } from '@busy-hour/react-native/hooks';

export default Main() {
  // highlight-start
  // We recommend you to use a state as the argument instead of fixed value
  // therefore the initialization will only happen once the service are initialized
  const { isInitialized, notificationToken, isError, } = useInitNotification(true)
  // highlight-end

  return <MainApp />
}
```
