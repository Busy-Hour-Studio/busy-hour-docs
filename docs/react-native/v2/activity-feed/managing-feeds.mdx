# Managing Activity Feeds

In this section, we will show you how to manage activity feeds from the activity feeds service.

## Prerequisites

<ActivityFeedPrerequisites />

## Managing Activity Feeds

To start managing your activity feeds (e.g. `create`, `delete`, etc.), you will need to use the `useFeedManager` hook which is exported from the `@busy-hour/react-native/hooks` or `@busy-hour/react-native/hooks/v2` package. To use it, you just need to call it like any other hook and it will return an object. For more detail about the properties see the detail from this table:

| Property      | Type       | Description                      |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| `createFeed`  | `function` | Create a new activity feed       |
| `deleteFeed`  | `function` | Delete an existing activity feed |
| `likeFeed`    | `function` | Listen to activity feeds         |
| `dislikeFeed` | `function` | Remove the listener              |

## Creating Activity Feeds

To create an activity feed, you can use the `createFeed` function which is one of the return properties of the `useFeedManager` hook. To use it, you need to pass some properties which detailed below.

| Property      | Type                          | Description                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | `string` (optional)           | The title of the activity feed               |
| `type`        | `feed` \| `string` (optional) | The type of the activity feed                |
| `description` | `string` (optional)           | The description of the activity feed         |
| `attachments` | `Attachment[]` (optional)     | Any file information for the activity feed   |
| `custom`      | `object` (optional)           | Any custom information for the activity feed |

### Quick Example

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"

import { useFeedManager } from '@busy-hour/react-native/hooks';

export default function Main() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { createFeed } = useFeedManager()

  const createNewFeed = () => {
    // highlight-start
    return createFeed({
      title: 'New activity feed',
      type: 'feed',
      description: 'This is a new activity feed',
      // Custom properties for the activity feed
      custom: {
        color: '#ff0000'
      }
    })
    // highlight-end
  }

  return <MainApp />;
}

```

## Deleting Activity Feeds

To delete an activity feed, you can use the `deleteFeed` function which is one of the return properties of the `useFeedManager` hook. To use it, you need to pass the `feedId` of the activity feed.

### Quick Example

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"

import { useFeedManager } from '@busy-hour/react-native/hooks';

export default function Main() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { deleteFeed } = useFeedManager()

  const deleteExistingFeed = () => {
    // highlight-start
    return deleteFeed('the-feed-id')
    // highlight-end
  }

  return <MainApp />;
}
```

## Liking Activity Feeds

To like an activity feed, you can use the `likeFeed` function which is one of the return properties of the `useFeedManager` hook. To use it, you need to pass the `feedId` of the activity feed and a `liked` boolean to determined to remove the like or not.

### Quick Example

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"

import { useFeedManager } from '@busy-hour/react-native/hooks';

export default function Main() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { likeFeed } = useFeedManager()

  const likeExistingFeed = () => {
    // highlight-start
    return likeFeed('the-feed-id', false) // Do not remove the like
    // highlight-end
  }

  return <MainApp />;
}
```

## Disliking Activity Feeds

To like an activity feed, you can use the `dislikeFeed` function which is one of the return properties of the `useFeedManager` hook. To use it, you need to pass the `feedId` of the activity feed and a `liked` boolean to determined to remove the dislike or not.

### Quick Example

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"

import { useFeedManager } from '@busy-hour/react-native/hooks';

export default function Main() {
  // highlight-next-line
  const { dislikeFeed } = useFeedManager()

  const dislikeExistingFeed = () => {
    // highlight-start
    return dislikeFeed('the-feed-id', true) // remove the dislike
    // highlight-end
  }

  return <MainApp />;
}
```
